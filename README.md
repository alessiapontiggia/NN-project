To run the notebook you just have to open the **"TransInpainter_1.ipynb"** file and run each cell sequentially. If the error "*Your session crashed after using all available RAM*" while running is encountered, then you can: 
1) use this link to access to the already existing notebook on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/alessiapontiggia/transinpainter
2) download the notebook and run it locally (after checking if the dependencies requested are already installed)

Moreover, the file **Project_Info.ipynb** contains the description of the implementation and methods used to recreate the paper **"Trans-Inpainter: Wireless Channel Information-
Guided Image Restoration via Multimodal Transformer"**.

All the files mentioned are visible in this repository.
