To run the notebook you just have to open the **"TransInpainter_1.ipynb"** file and run each cell sequentially. If the error "*Your session crashed after using all available RAM*" while running is encountered, then you can: 
1) download the notebook and import it on kaggle
2) use this link to access to the already existing notebook on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/alessiapontiggia/transinpainter   

Moreover, the file **Project_Info.ipynb** contains the description of the implementation and methods used to recreate the paper **"Trans-Inpainter: Wireless Channel Information-
Guided Image Restoration via Multimodal Transformer"**.

All the files mentioned are visible in this repository.
